# UnobtainableAudio

The challenge conditions:

- To try not to change or influence the personal behaviors, habits and practices of those who have permitted access to any audio file required to proctor listening exams.
- To negate any risk of audio files falling into the wrong hands when files are left on public computers, files are lost or misplaced, or websites hosting audio resources are (signed-into and) left unattended.
- To enforce the 'play the audio only one time' rule (an exam condition).

Based on the above conditions, the challenge becomes:

- To make an audio file unreadable in all environments, except when required to be played by a person with permitted access.
- To make an audio file unreadable at all times, except when required to be played during a specific hour / day / week / etc.
