# UnobtainableAudio

Subtle crypto experiments...

@ decrypt_audio:

- To not change the current practice of permitting exam audio files be downloadable and copyable.
- To negate any risk of audio files falling into the wrong hands when files are left on public computers, files are lost or misplaced, or websites hosting audio resources are (signed-into and) left unattended.
- To enforce 'playing the audio only one time'.
- To make audio files unreadable in all environments, except when required to be played by a person with permitted access and at a designated time.

N.b.: The demo makes use of flatfiles.
