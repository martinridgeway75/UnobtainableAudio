# UnobtainableAudio

Subtle crypto experiments...

The audio file challenge:

- To not change the current practice of permitting access to audio files required to proctor listening exams.
- To negate any risk of audio files falling into the wrong hands when files are left on public computers, files are lost or misplaced, or websites hosting audio resources are (signed-into and) left unattended.
- To enforce the 'play the audio only one time' rule (an exam condition).
- To make an audio file unreadable in all environments, except when required to be played by a person with permitted access and at a designated time.
